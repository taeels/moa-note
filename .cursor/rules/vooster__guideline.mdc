# Code Guideline Document

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project delivers a weekly digest web application that automatically clusters and summarizes Gerrit commits per team member, leveraging AI for concise, actionable summaries. The core stack includes:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (TypeScript), Ant Design 5, TailwindCSS, React Context, React Query
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, Celery, Pydantic v2, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7
- **AI:** Internal LLM (Llama 2) via LangChain pipeline
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (on-prem), Helm, GitLab CI/CD

Key architectural decisions:
- Domain-driven folder structure (user, digest, feedback, infra)
- Clear separation of presentation, service, repository, and infra layers
- RESTful API with OpenAPI schema, JWT-based OIDC authentication
- Async processing for AI summarization via Celery workers
- Caching and state management via Redis, React Query

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Single Responsibility:** Every module/class/function MUST have exactly one clear responsibility.
2. **Explicitness:** All code MUST be explicit in intent; avoid implicit behavior or hidden side effects.
3. **Consistency:** Follow established naming, structure, and style conventions across the codebase.
4. **Testability:** All business logic MUST be unit-testable and covered by automated tests.
5. **Security First:** Sensitive data (e.g., tokens) MUST be handled securely; never hard-code secrets.

## 3. Language-Specific Guidelines

### 3.1 TypeScript (Next.js Frontend)

- **File Organization**
  - MUST organize by domain: `/src/components/`, `/src/pages/`, `/src/hooks/`, `/src/services/`, `/src/utils/`
  - Each React component in its own file; group related components in folders.
  - Shared types/interfaces in `/src/types/`.
- **Import/Dependency Management**
  - MUST use absolute imports from `src/` root.
  - MUST import only used modules; avoid entire library imports (e.g., `import { Button } from 'antd'` not `import * as antd from 'antd'`).
  - Third-party dependencies MUST be declared in `package.json` and updated via PR.
- **Error Handling**
  - All async calls (e.g., fetch, API) MUST use `try/catch`.
  - Errors from services/hooks MUST propagate meaningful messages.

```typescript
// MUST: Clear async error handling in a service
export async function fetchDigest(userId: string) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/digest/${userId}`);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch digest');
    return await res.json();
  } catch (e) {
    // Log and rethrow for UI handling
    console.error(e);
    throw e;
  }
}
```

```typescript
// MUST NOT: Swallowing errors or ignoring async failures
export async function fetchDigest(userId: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/digest/${userId}`);
  // No error handling
  return res.json(); // This may fail silently
}
```

### 3.2 Python (FastAPI Backend)

- **File Organization**
  - MUST use `/app/domains/` for business logic grouped by domain (e.g., `/digest/`, `/user/`, `/feedback/`)
  - `/app/api/` for route definitions; `/app/core/` for shared infrastructure; `/app/utils/` for helpers.
  - Each model/schema in its own file.
- **Import/Dependency Management**
  - MUST use absolute imports within the app.
  - Third-party dependencies MUST be listed in `pyproject.toml`.
  - Circular imports MUST be avoided.
- **Error Handling**
  - MUST handle all external API/database calls with `try/except`.
  - API endpoints MUST return standardized error responses (HTTPException with detail).

```python
# MUST: Proper error handling in a repository method
from fastapi import HTTPException

def get_digest_by_user(db, user_id: int):
    try:
        digest = db.query(Digest).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
        if not digest:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Digest not found")
        return digest
    except Exception as e:
        # Log and return 500 error
        logger.exception("DB error")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
```

```python
# MUST NOT: Unhandled exceptions or generic catch-alls
def get_digest_by_user(db, user_id: int):
    return db.query(Digest).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
    # No error handling, may leak stacktrace or crash worker
```

---

## 4. Code Style Rules

### 4.1 MUST Follow

- **TypeScript**
  - MUST use strict typing (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`).
  - MUST use functional components and React Hooks.
  - MUST use ESLint and Prettier; code MUST pass lint and formatting checks before merge.
  - MUST destructure props and state for clarity.
  - Rationale: Enforces type safety, readability, and maintainability.

```typescript
// MUST: Typed functional component and prop destructuring
type DigestProps = { digest: DigestSummary };
const DigestCard: React.FC<DigestProps> = ({ digest }) => (
  <Card>
    <p>{digest.summary}</p>
  </Card>
);
```

- **Python**
  - MUST use type hints for all functions and methods.
  - MUST use Pydantic models for all input/output schemas.
  - MUST document all public functions and classes with docstrings.
  - MUST use Black and isort for formatting and import order.
  - Rationale: Ensures code clarity, schema validation, and uniform style.

```python
# MUST: Function with type hints and docstring
def summarize_commits(commits: List[Commit]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a summary for the provided list of commits.
    """
    ...
```

### 4.2 MUST NOT Do

- MUST NOT write multi-responsibility modules (e.g., service, model, and API in one file).
- MUST NOT use any/unknown in TypeScript except when absolutely necessary and justified.
- MUST NOT use magic numbers/strings; define constants in a shared location.
- MUST NOT commit commented-out code or unused imports.
- MUST NOT block the event loop in FastAPI or Celery (e.g., synchronous I/O in async routes).
- MUST NOT use complex, ad-hoc state management patterns; always use React Context or React Query.

```typescript
// MUST NOT: Multi-responsibility file
// Contains API call, state management, and UI in one file – split these concerns!
```

```python
# MUST NOT: Synchronous DB call in async endpoint
@app.get("/digest")
async def get_digest():
    digest = db.query(Digest).all()  # BAD: blocks event loop
    return digest
```

## 5. Architecture Patterns

### 5.1 Component/Module Structure

- **Frontend**
  - MUST organize by domain: components, hooks, services, utils.
  - Each UI component MUST be reusable and stateless where possible.
  - Shared state MUST be managed via React Context or React Query.
- **Backend**
  - MUST separate API (route), service (business logic), repository (DB access), and infra (external services).
  - Each domain folder MUST include models, schemas, and services.

```typescript
// MUST: Example folder structure
/src/digest/
  ├── DigestCard.tsx
  ├── useDigest.ts
  ├── digestService.ts
  └── types.ts
```

```python
# MUST: Example backend domain module
/app/domains/digest/
  ├── models.py
  ├── schemas.py
  ├── service.py
  └── repository.py
```

### 5.2 Data Flow Patterns

- **Frontend**
  - All server data fetching MUST use React Query for caching and revalidation.
  - Local UI state (e.g., Accordion open/close) MUST use useState/useReducer.
- **Backend**
  - API endpoints MUST validate input with Pydantic models.
  - Service layer handles business logic; repository layer handles DB.
  - Celery tasks MUST be idempotent and log status.

```typescript
// MUST: Data fetching pattern
const { data, error } = useQuery(['digest', userId], () => fetchDigest(userId));
```

### 5.3 State Management Conventions

- **Frontend**
  - Global app state (e.g., user, theme) MUST use React Context.
  - Server state (e.g., digests, feedback) MUST use React Query.
  - MUST NOT use Redux or other state libraries unless justified.
- **Backend**
  - Application state MUST NOT be stored in memory; use Redis/PostgreSQL.
  - Task status and cache MUST use Redis with defined TTL.

### 5.4 API Design Standards

- All endpoints MUST be RESTful, use nouns for resources, and support standard HTTP methods.
- All responses MUST follow a consistent envelope: `{ data, error, meta }`.
- All endpoints MUST be documented via OpenAPI (FastAPI auto-docs).
- All errors MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

```python
# MUST: API response envelope
@app.get("/digest/{user_id}", response_model=DigestResponse)
async def get_digest(user_id: int):
    try:
        digest = await service.get_digest(user_id)
        return {"data": digest, "error": None, "meta": {"requested_at": datetime.utcnow()}}
    except HTTPException as e:
        return {"data": None, "error": str(e.detail), "meta": {}}
```

## 6. Quality Criteria

- All code MUST be reviewed and pass automated lint, format, and test checks before merge.
- All business logic MUST have ≥80% unit test coverage.
- All sensitive operations MUST be logged (excluding secrets).
- All external API calls MUST have error handling and timeouts.
- All code MUST be written in English, including comments, identifiers, and documentation.
